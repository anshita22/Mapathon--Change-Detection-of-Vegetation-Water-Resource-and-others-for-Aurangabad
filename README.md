# Change Detection of Vegetation, Water Resource and others for Aurangabad

  The data collected from Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) platforms have tremendous potential in mapping India’s resources, agriculture, climate and disaster management, rural and urban planning and in identifying pathways for future development. Such maps can be created using free open source platforms (such as QGIS).
  
  This Project is a part of nationwide Mapathon Competition in which we classified the data, analysed the results and presented the findings about the effect of urbanization on water resourcesand vegetationon Aurangabad city, Maharashtra. We used LISS-III satellite datacollected over a period of 10 years from 2008 to 2018 by ISRO.

Here are the maps we created after processing.
